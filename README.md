# Lettuce Books

I don't know if I'm bad budgeting my money or it's just such a tedious task and I don't have the patience or education to do it right. But I no longer have the luxury of not ignoring the 'books'.  So I need to get serious and get some semblance of discipline to get better with managing my money. My previous attemps include spending hours building complex spreadsheets listing out what my debts and budget are but unfortunately they are too static. I've also put hours into learning each of the tools like quickbooks, mint, YNAB but for whatever reasons they don't stick with me.

But now I _really_ need to get a handle on my money and this little app is my attempt. I don't plan to win any code awards. My goal is to manage my money. My goal is to turn 'bookkeeping... _ugh_ into bookkeeping... _ahh_'
