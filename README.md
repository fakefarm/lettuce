# Lettuce Books

I don't know if I'm bad at budgeting money because it's such a tedious task and I lack the patience, if I'm not doing it right, or I simply haven't found a tool that I can stick with it.

But I no longer have the luxury of ignoring the 'books'. It's time for me to get _seriouser_ and manage my money for real. My previous attempts include spending hours building complex spreadsheets listing out what my debts and budget are but unfortunately they are too static. I've also put hours into learning each of the tools like quickbooks, mint, YNAB but for whatever reasons they don't stick with me.

So I'm going to take a risk and rather than build another spreadsheet or try to learn someone else's software, I'm going to _roll my own!_. Yep I know this is probably the hardest path of them all. But seems that I would be crazy if I went back to trying old ways and expect different results. Here's to scratching my own itch. Wish me luck! I don't plan to win any code awards. My goal is to manage my money and turn 'bookkeeping... _ugh_ into bookkeeping... _ahh_'
